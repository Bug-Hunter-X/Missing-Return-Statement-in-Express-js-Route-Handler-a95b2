This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: a missing `return` statement within a conditional block.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.  This omission can cause unexpected behavior, as multiple responses might be sent, leading to errors or inconsistent results. The solution ensures that only one response is sent, improving the reliability and predictability of the application.
